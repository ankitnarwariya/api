# Cat Facts

## Things I Learned in This Project:

1. **Fetch API:**

   - Utilized the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests and handle data retrieval.

2. **Fetching API Using Axios:**

   - Explored the Axios library to simplify and enhance the process of fetching data from an external API.

3. **Tailwind CSS:**
   - Implemented styling with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a visually appealing user interface.

## Project Overview:

I developed this application using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The main functionality involves fetching data from a free API using the Fetch API. It is designed as a production-grade application, addressing errors gracefully and incorporating a loading indicator during data retrieval.

Feel free to explore the code for insights into handling asynchronous requests, integrating external APIs, and styling with Tailwind CSS.

**Note:** Ensure to install the necessary dependencies before running the application.
